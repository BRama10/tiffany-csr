**Published In:** Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders

#### Background
The study investigates the association between specific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the frequency of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among veterans. It specifically examines diclofenac, etodolac, and naproxen, utilizing pharmacy transaction records from the US Department of Veterans Affairs.

#### Methods
- **Study Design:** Retrospective cohort study.
- **Participants:** Veterans diagnosed with AD were identified using ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Drug exposure was tracked for diclofenac, etodolac, and naproxen.
- **Analysis:** Cox regression survival analysis was employed to evaluate the relationship between AD frequency and NSAID exposure over time, controlling for age and comorbidity indices.

#### Results
- **Prevalence of AD:** The prevalence of AD was significantly lower in the diclofenac group (0.28%) compared to etodolac (2.24%) and naproxen (1.66%).
- **Hazard Ratios:** The hazard ratio for developing AD was significantly lower for diclofenac (HR 0.25) compared to naproxen, indicating a protective effect.
- **Comorbidities:** The study found that age and medication-based disease burden were significant predictors of AD development.

#### Conclusion
Diclofenac use is associated with a significantly lower prevalence of AD compared to other NSAIDs. The results suggest that diclofenac may have neuroprotective properties, potentially due to its effects on amyloid beta and interleukin-1 beta.

### Implications for Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease

1. **Neuroprotective Properties of Diclofenac:**
   - The study highlights diclofenac's potential as a neuroprotective agent, which could be repurposed for AD treatment. Its ability to reduce inflammatory markers and amyloid beta accumulation positions it as a candidate for further clinical trials.

2. **Comparison with Other NSAIDs:**
   - The findings indicate that while other NSAIDs like etodolac and naproxen do not show the same protective effect, diclofenac's unique properties warrant further investigation. This suggests that not all NSAIDs are equal in their potential effects on AD.

3. **Need for Prospective Studies:**
   - The authors emphasize the necessity for randomized controlled trials to confirm the findings and explore the mechanisms through which diclofenac exerts its effects. Such studies could validate diclofenac as a therapeutic option for AD.

4. **Potential Mechanisms:**
   - The paper discusses the role of inflammation in AD pathology and how diclofenac may modulate neuroinflammation, making it a promising candidate for drug repurposing.

5. **Clinical Relevance:**
   - Given the aging population and the increasing incidence of AD, repurposing diclofenac could provide a cost-effective strategy for managing or preventing AD in at-risk populations.

### Conclusion
The study presents compelling evidence that diclofenac may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting its potential for repurposing as a therapeutic agent. Further research is essential to elucidate its mechanisms and confirm its efficacy in AD management.
