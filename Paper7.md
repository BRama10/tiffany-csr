#### Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive decline. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief, with limited effectiveness. Methylprednisolone (MP), a glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory properties, is investigated for its potential neuroprotective effects in AD.

#### Objectives
The study aims to explore the effects of MP on cognitive dysfunction in Aβ42-induced AD mice, focusing on its role in modulating neuroinflammation and synaptic function.

#### Methods
- **Animal Model:** C57BL/6 mice were used, divided into control, Aβ42-induced, and MP-treated groups.
- **Cognitive Assessments:** The Morris Water Maze and Y-maze tests evaluated spatial learning and memory.
- **Molecular Analysis:** RNA sequencing was performed to assess gene expression changes related to synaptic function and inflammation.

#### Results
1. **Cognitive Improvement:** MP treatment significantly improved cognitive deficits in Aβ42-induced mice, as evidenced by better performance in the Morris Water Maze and Y-maze tests.
2. **Microglial Activation:** MP reduced microglial activation in the cortex and hippocampus, indicating its anti-inflammatory effects.
3. **Gene Expression:** RNA sequencing revealed that MP altered the expression of genes associated with synaptic function and immune response, suggesting a mechanism by which MP exerts its neuroprotective effects.

#### Discussion
The findings suggest that MP can alleviate cognitive dysfunction in AD by:
- Inhibiting microglial activation, thereby reducing neuroinflammation.
- Enhancing synaptic function through the regulation of specific gene expressions.

### Implications for Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease

1. **Potential as a Therapeutic Agent:** The study highlights MP's potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment, leveraging its anti-inflammatory properties to address neuroinflammation, a critical factor in AD progression.

2. **Combination Therapy:** The results suggest that MP could be used in combination with existing AD treatments, potentially enhancing their efficacy by addressing both neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits.

3. **Further Research Needed:** While MP shows promise, further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanisms of action, optimal dosing, and long-term effects to ensure safety and efficacy in human populations.

4. **Clinical Relevance:** Given the limited options for modifying the course of AD, repurposing MP could provide a new avenue for treatment, particularly for patients with significant neuroinflammatory components in their disease profile.

### Conclusion
This study provides compelling evidence that MP may serve as a viable candidate for drug repurposing in Alzheimer's disease, primarily through its anti-inflammatory effects and potential to improve cognitive function. Future research should focus on clinical trials to validate these findings and explore the therapeutic window for MP in AD management.
